# Album Rater — v3

PWA for scoring albums with a super-fast UI (integer + decimal pickers). Now with:
- Language selector (English/Spanish), persisted in localStorage.
- Auto-save (localStorage). Data restores on reload.
- Export/Import JSON (share or back up your data).
- Clear All Data button (with confirmation).
- Ready base for future "Export Story (1080x1920)" feature.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages
1) Create a public repo (e.g., `album-rater`).
2) Upload these files **uncompressed**: `index.html`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`, folder `icons/`, and `.nojekyll` (optional).
3) Settings → Pages → "Deploy from a branch" → branch `main`, folder `/`.
4) Open your public URL and (on iPhone) "Add to Home Screen" for a full-screen app.
